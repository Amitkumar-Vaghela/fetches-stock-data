# fetches-stock-data
The script fetches intraday stock data using the API.


Certainly! Let's break down the important information about the provided trading-related Python script:

Purpose:
The script fetches intraday stock data using the Alpha Vantage API.

Dependencies:
The script uses the requests library to make HTTP requests. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip install requests.

Script Overview:
The get_stock_data function takes a stock symbol and an API key as parameters.
It constructs a URL with the Alpha Vantage API endpoint and makes a request to retrieve intraday stock data for the specified symbol.
The response is then processed, and information such as the latest timestamp, open, high, low, close, and volume are printed.

Usage:
The script is designed to be run from the command line. You can replace the placeholder values for api_key and stock_symbol with your Alpha Vantage API key and the stock symbol you are interested in, respectively.

Important Notes:
The script is a basic example and may need enhancements for a production environment (e.g., error handling, logging, proper API rate limiting handling, etc.).
Alpha Vantage's free API tier has usage limitations, so be aware of these limitations to avoid disruptions.

Future Improvements:
Depending on your goals, you might want to extend the script to include more features like historical data retrieval, technical analysis, or integration with other APIs.
